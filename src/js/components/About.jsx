      <p>
        Hi 👋🏻 I’m <strong>Morena Nicora</strong>, a <strong>Frontend Developer</strong> who enjoys creating
        <strong> interactive</strong> and <strong> visually appealing</strong> web applications.
        I like working on projects that challenge my <strong>logic</strong> and <strong>creativity</strong>,
        from small utilities to complete applications.
      </p>

      <p>
        I’m especially interested in <strong>JavaScript</strong> and <strong>React</strong>, and I enjoy learning
        by building <strong>real projects</strong>.
        I also have a growing interest in <strong>cybersecurity</strong>, focusing on
        <strong>web security fundamentals</strong> and <strong>best practices</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        My goal is to continue growing as a <strong>developer</strong>, strengthen my
        <strong>problem-solving skills</strong>,
        and expand my knowledge toward <strong>full-stack development</strong> and
        <strong> secure application design</strong>.
